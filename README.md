# How to build
### Follow LineageOS setup instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/i9305/build)
Skip everything after "Initialize the LineageOS source repository".

# Download the LineageOS source

#### initialize a shallow clone instead of a full one
    cd ~/android/lineage
    repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b cm-14.1 --depth 1

#### sync up
    repo sync

# Getting the device sources

### Download the device tree and kernel
Make sure that you are inside the LineageOS source code root.

#### Clone the device tree, kernel and vendor
    git clone https://github.com/2003Frost/android_device_asus_Z01M.git -b cm-14.1 --depth 1 device/asus/Z01M_Kernel
    git clone https://github.com/2003Frost/android_kernel_asus_Z01M.git --depth 1 kernel/asus/Z01M

# Prepare the build environment
    source build/envsetup.sh

#### Select one of these build variants
    lineage_Z01M-userdebug
    lineage_Z01M-user
    lineage_Z01M-eng

If you don't know which one to pick, [see](https://source.android.com/setup/build/building#choose-a-target)
I'm choosing the userdebug one so I do.

    lunch lineage_Z01M-userdebug

#### And build
    brunch

You can also use the -j option (eg. -j1 or -j4) to specify how much parallel tasks you want to use.
If you don't provide a -j argument, the build system automatically selects a parallel task count that it thinks is optimal for your system.

So an example of that looks like.

    brunch -j3

### The build should be located somewhere in out/target/product/Z01M/ in The LineageOS code root.

#### The build zip can be installed with TWRP
